        <h2>First 9-1-22</h2>
        <p>Its not going well, fuck. Im writing this at 1am sleep deprived for the last few days. I feel like senioritis
          is hitting already. Theres like 30 more weeks left until graduation, god that feels.... wierd? not long, just really wierd.
          Classes are getting tougher. apparently every teacher thinks an hour of homework a night due the next day is a good idea.
          I feel like i go through phases of feeling like "Fuck this is too easy" and "What the actual fuck, theres no way
          doing this much work is actually humanly possible". College applications are fun arent they? I was sitting there half
          awake filling in every single one of the courses Ive taken in highschoool, and I realized that I was completly on autopilot
          . not like half there, I was completely gone. Its kinda boring after a bit trying to convince a bunch of schools that 
          you should be the lucky one they choose, and why youre a special little snowflake that isnt like the others, and actually 
          liked doing a million hours of commuity service. And you actually liked being signed up to 20 differnt clubs, and you actually like 
          Taking useless AP classes because you just love a challenge dont you as if you havent been perfectly coached by a 
          college prepper to make your personality formulacially perfect. Thats not actually what the councelors her do, they are
          actually pretty good. I think its the videos I see online. There seems to be this consensus that there is a F(x) formulacial
          model to get you to where you want to go, when in reality I think its half lottery, half what the admissions officers had
          for lunch that day, and whatever percent left is what matters from your application. God I just want to be done. Im worried about
          whats going to happen after im done. Will I just be in pain knowing I still gotta do all the work even though It wont matter.
          Well some colleges ask for grade updates, but it feels like it doesnt matter atleast, I could get in by the end of the year, 
          and still have a simester to go, then would it matter?

        <h2>What is SJSPR.ME</h2>
        <p>SJSPR.ME is a personal blog run by a senior of the sjs class. This blog is in no way
          sponsored or affiliated with the class board. New posts happen every monday, no set time. 
          These posts are hopefully going to be as unfiltered as possible. I will try to share what
          im feeling about the class board, sjs, and being as a senior as a whole (not what I expected).
          Hopefully you enjoy it!
