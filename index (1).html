        <h2>9-5-22</h2>
        <p>Horrray, another week in the can and it feels like im no closer to getting out of here. At the moment to be completely honest im numb
          , I just dont know what the hell is going on. It feels like im on autopilot and life is just going past me. I can barely get a look long
          enough to tell what the hell is going on. Fuck, is this it, is this adulthood, is it just 60 more years of this, christ, if APs arent 
          depressing enough that sure is. Sorry these last two entries have been kind of depressing, I think it might just be how 
          I'm feeling, although I suspect a lot of the others feel the same way too. Do you ever feel like you dont even know what
          youre doing this for? I think in 9th grade I was really excited to work twards the goal of getting into the college I wanted to
          , and wide eyed, and bushy tailed about what it would be like to get that piece of paper on that stage. Now, I know exactly how
          getting that piece of paper I spent four years of my life on is going to feel. Its going to feel exactly like how every other piece 
          of paper Ive ever gotten on a stage feels. Lifeless, devoid of any decernable emotion. If youve never gotten a shiny piece of paper
          on a stage with people watching this is the drill. First, make sure you get up from your seat as fast as possible to make it seem like
          youre exicited. Then make sure you give the person giving you the shiny piece of paper a firm handshake so it seems like you care 
          about that piece of paper, and lastly, when people congradulate you on your shiny piece of paper, make sure you talk about how good 
          it feels, and how amazing, and worth it, and defenetly not agonizingly soulcrusing that you need to pretend to care about this 
          shiny piece of paper that maby meant something 50 fucking years ago, but now is just the bare minimum, of bare minimums, of the start of the 
          begining, of what you are going to need to do just so you dont fucking starve to death on a cold sidewalk in illinois with nothing
          to your name alone, with nothing to show for all those years you spent doing something you didnt want to. Yeah maby this is getting a bit too depressing, atleast we're getting 
          letterman jackets, they look kinda cool atleast. And hey, atleast theres (or atleast supposed to be) a party pretty soon. Yippie

        <h2> 9-1-22</h2>
        <p>Its not going well, fuck. Im writing this at 1am sleep deprived for the last few days. I feel like senioritis
          is hitting already. Theres like 30 more weeks left until graduation, god that feels.... wierd? not long, just really wierd.
          Classes are getting tougher. apparently every teacher thinks an hour of homework a night due the next day is a good idea.
          I feel like i go through phases of feeling like "Fuck this is too easy" and "What the actual fuck, theres no way
          doing this much work is actually humanly possible". College applications are fun arent they? I was sitting there half
          awake filling in every single one of the courses Ive taken in highschoool, and I realized that I was completly on autopilot
          . not like half there, I was completely gone. Its kinda boring after a bit trying to convince a bunch of schools that 
          you should be the lucky one they choose, and why youre a special little snowflake that isnt like the others, and actually 
          liked doing a million hours of commuity service. And you actually liked being signed up to 20 differnt clubs, and you actually like 
          Taking useless AP classes because you just love a challenge dont you as if you havent been perfectly coached by a 
          college prepper to make your personality formulacially perfect. Thats not actually what the councelors her do, they are
          actually pretty good. I think its the videos I see online. There seems to be this consensus that there is a F(x) formulacial
          model to get you to where you want to go, when in reality I think its half lottery, half what the admissions officers had
          for lunch that day, and whatever percent left is what matters from your application. God I just want to be done. Im worried about
          whats going to happen after im done. Will I just be in pain knowing I still gotta do all the work even though It wont matter.
          Well some colleges ask for grade updates, but it feels like it doesnt matter atleast, I could get in by the end of the year, 
          and still have a simester to go, then would it matter?

        <h2>What is SJSPR.ME</h2>
        <p>SJSPR.ME is a personal blog run by a senior of the sjs class. This blog is in no way
          sponsored or affiliated with the class board. New posts happen every monday, no set time. 
          These posts are hopefully going to be as unfiltered as possible. I will try to share what
          im feeling about the class board, sjs, and being as a senior as a whole (not what I expected).
          Hopefully you enjoy it!
